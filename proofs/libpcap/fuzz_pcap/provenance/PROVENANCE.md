# How the binaries of `libpcap/fuzz_pcap` were built

Generated from `PROVENANCE.yaml` beside this file. The build files are in `recipe/` (`recipe/MANIFEST.tsv` lists them) and the licence texts in `LICENSES/`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap at `7fc0bcd48aee89f0b09fdc1c10346fe55b386a80` |
| OSS-Fuzz project | https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz `projects/libpcap` at `bd2ce21991a9` |
| Entry point | `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` |
| Harness | `source/fuzz_pcap.c` from https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap `testprogs/fuzz/fuzz_pcap.c` at `7fc0bcd48aee`; unmodified; licence BSD-3-Clause |
| Recipe | `recipe.tar.zst` of release `v2026.10.0-src` (sha256 `0339bf3221b15cd39513d46abe99062bac9cce874ed7ba5947753f75b6219ae5`), target `libpcap-fuzz_pcap` |
| Build system | cmake |
| Patches to the library | none |
| Compiler | clang 20.1.8 |
| Builder image | `ghcr.io/theorem-labs/oss-fuzz-theorems-toolchain@sha256:6a6b4816865c7ec61801ae0fcab6d9c81a599ffcb20616576a9c668abd8b0a7b` |
| Static AddressSanitizer | https://github.com/theorem-labs/static-asan at `b05061352064fa2be1813ac5429149f3de5f057d` (the published source of the compiler image's static AddressSanitizer: its toolchain/ and patches/ are those the image was built from, with comments and patch descriptions edited for publication (toolchain-src.tar.zst holds this commit). Building it gives the image's libclang_rt.builtins.a and musl libc.a byte for byte; its libclang_rt.asan.a and asan_cxx.a differ from the image's only in DWARF line tables, which --strip-all removes from the binaries) |
| Source code | not required by the licences; the upstream source is `libpcap-src.tar.zst` of release `v2026.10.0-src` |

## Rebuild

- rebuilt from this recipe and the source assets on a separate machine: plain identical, asan identical, ubsan identical, asan-ubsan identical

## The proofs' licence

The proof files of this entry point were made from final-anthropic-opensource-formal-verification-proofs-package-2026-10-21 (sha256 4c6c152f61ce538e439b9d2adef439f4dbe1a2d446767d84ac7c3946d7c6687a), libraries/libpcap/proofs/submission-1 and are under Apache-2.0 OR MIT, at the recipient's option: the licence texts and the notice are `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-LICENSE`, `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-NOTICE` in the repository's top directory; each changed file carries one line under its licence header saying so. The proofs of asan_agreement_decidable, asan_disagrees_at_most, asan_ubsan_agreement_decidable, asan_ubsan_disagrees_at_most, ubsan_agreement_decidable and ubsan_disagrees_at_most were written in this repository: they use lib/ConstAccept.v, a program that accepts every input, to decide where the builds agree and to bound their disagreement at 0.

## Compiler and linker flags

As written in the recipe; a library's own build system adds its flags after these (e.g. CMake Release appends -O3 -DNDEBUG), see the pin and recipes.sh.
