(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: proofs/reac-pw/fuzz_role/lib/A/RPgPropIntB.v at a529a88a6181 (the block lemma pa_int7 and its helpers) and the piece pa_piece_int7 of proofs/reac-pw/fuzz_role/lib/A/RPgProp.v at the same commit, for reac-pw/fuzz_rate image A: rate's pcs (SEL7 0x80e6c, the memset call 0x80fec to 0x51cfc with return 0x80ff0, LATCH7 0x82530), registers (s6 / s7 / s2 for role's s4 / s5 / s7) and real-frame cells (i at R+0xf8, -0x3ffd at R+0x130, -0x4001 at R+0x118 and in s10); rate's block keeps what is left of the input (s8) in s10 across the pad and restores s8 and s10 at its end, so both join the clobbered set and the block's relation states their end values; the call is lib/A/RtPgSteps.v rts_intrin_at (in place of pa_i_memset_at), the region lemma its rts_region_nth (in place of pa_i_region_nth); the block post is RtPgSteps' rts_post; the cut lists of the piece are lib/A/RtPgSeg.v's. *)

   RtPgSeg.rs_piece_W7a_stmt, ent_build's case 0 from its two entries D0 = 0x81334 and D0E = 0x813a0 to G = 0x8150c
   (pod.h:224-249). Proves no function (kind: segment lemma).

   HOW. lib/A/RtPgEnt0Def.v rt7_piece reduces the piece to three block statements, each proved in its own file:
   the head (lib/A/RtPgEnt0Hd.v rt7_head: D0 / D0E to the arms DIG 0x813f8 and ODD 0x81b6c), the digits arm
   (lib/A/RtPgEnt0Dig.v rt7_dig: DIG to G) and the odd_ch arm (lib/A/RtPgEnt0Odd.v rt7_odd: ODD to G). Only the odd_ch
   arm calls out of the program: the strlen wrapper at 0x42194 and __asan_memcpy at 0x51860, whose contracts are the
   two hypotheses below (lib/A/Rt/StrlenDef.v astrlen_realizes; the kit's YG0d.v aintrin_realizes). *)
