(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-11: made from proofs/bzip2/bzip2_compress_target/lib/K/Lib/SysStep.v; 3 of its 16 lines of code are new or changed and 401 lines of the source are left out. *)

(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: proofs/reac-pw/fuzz_rate/lib/A/Bz/Lib/SysStep.v at 71994ff034c7, derived by derive_y.py: addresses moved from reac-pw/fuzz_rate's asan image (image A) to its asan-ubsan image (image B), the image module Asan -> AsanUbsan; the Modified-by lines above describe how lib/A/Bz/Lib/SysStep.v was made and quote that file's image-A values; the code below carries image B's values; a numeral in a comment that quotes the donor's text (lib/A/Bz/Lib/SysStep.v keeps its donor's comment text) is kept as lib/A/Bz/Lib/SysStep.v writes it. *)
