(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-11: made from proofs/bzip2/bzip2_compress_target/lib/K/P/Startup_glue.v, with its module paths changed; 4 of its 13 lines of code are new or changed and 74 lines of the source are left out. *)

(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: the asan-ubsan twin of lib/A/Bz/P/Startup_glue.v of this library, for reac-pw/fuzz_pin's asan-ubsan image (fuzz_pin.asan-ubsan d6f83d301522) instead of its asan image (fuzz_pin.asan 3e4859aed23f): module paths lib.A -> lib.AU; no numeral changed (every address numeral checked on the asan-ubsan image). The comment lines above describe how lib/A/Bz/P/Startup_glue.v was made and quote the asan image's values; the code and comments below carry the asan-ubsan values. *)
