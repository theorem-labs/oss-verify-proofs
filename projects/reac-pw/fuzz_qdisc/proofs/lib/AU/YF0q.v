(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: derived from lib/A/AF0q.v of this library by derive_y.py: module names A.Axyz -> AU.Yxyz, addresses moved from reac-pw/fuzz_qdisc's asan image to its asan-ubsan image. The Modified-by lines above describe how lib/A/AF0q.v was made and quote that file's asan-image values; the code below carries the asan-ubsan values. *)

Theorem afree_realizes_closed : forall B, TfibSyms B -> (forall t, as_dhash B t = tfib_dhash t) -> afree_realizes tfibsegs B.
Proof. intros B TS HD. exact (afree_realizes_all B TS HD). Qed.
