(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: the walk of reac_box_catalogue on fuzz_segconf.asan-ubsan (image B, pin sha256
   c3796c0b38f3, twin 80e82127e8ca; entry 0x8a8a0, 84 bytes, 21 instructions, a 16-byte frame, no side-stack
   frame): reac_box_catalogue_contract of lib/B/Prog/reac_box_catalogue_c.v (image B's copy of the image-A owner's FINAL
   text at 6f783602b5e3) at image B's numbers, in plugin-hostd/fuzz_command's lib/A/Prog form (afn_pre at the
   entry, SRr of apost_base at the return, over `Context {PI : PAImg seg_listing}` of image B's listing,
   lib/B/Prog/SegPa.v).
   ADAPTATION (relocation + one trap) of lib/A/Prog/reac_box_catalogueA.v (the image-A m_file-family lane, commit
   434ade288123, both arms): the same entry seeds, token runs and return steps over image B's listing modules and
   B's kit copies. The UBSan alignment check is read from proofs/libreac/fuzz_identity/lib/B/Prog/reac_box_catalogue.v
   at origin/ossv/recipes 3abc3740de97 (the same image-B code but 4 pc-relative words; caller-journal form, not
   copied), whose token run decides it the same way.
   Image B's code differs from image A's by two instructions: `andi a1,a0,7` (0x8a8ac) and `bnez a1,0x8a8ec`
   (0x8a8b0) to `unimp` (0x8a8ec), the UBSan alignment check of the 8-byte store through c.
   UBSan trap branch (one): 0x8a8b0 `bnez a1` -> unimp 0x8a8ec. Not taken: the c <> 0 run's entry seed carries the
   fact (10%nat, mkAF 4096 (2 ^ 47 - 8) 3) on a0 (rbc_facts: c is 2^3-aligned, from the contract premise
   c mod 8 = 0, seeded by rbc_entry), so the token executor (paj_run_tok, its branch step under facts_ok) computes
   a1 = c & 7 = 0 and decides the branch not taken; the trap instruction is never executed. The c = 0 run leaves at
   the beqz 0x8a8a8 (a0 pinned to 0) before the check.
   c <> 0: the instrumented check of the 8-byte cell (a load of the shadow byte at (c >> 3) + the shadow base, lbu
   0x8a8c8, and a compare, bnez 0x8a8cc) reads 0, because the contract's sa_addr gives the cell addressable; so the
   error path (the call of errpath_store8 at 0x8a8f0) is not reached; the sd at 0x8a8d4 writes 11 as 8 bytes. In
   both arms a0 = fuzz_catalogue (auipc/addi 0x8a8d8-0x8a8dc, 0xa20a0). The shadow base is the word the GOT cell
   as_got_shadow B holds (image B 0xa3210, the ld at 0x8a8b8, listing object 0; its target
   __asan_shadow_memory_dynamic_address 0xac7b8, listing object 12): the walk takes both from PALib (pal_got_shadow,
   pal_cell), a listing fact, not a contract premise.
   Positional names checked against image B's own listing (lib/B/Prog/SegAddr.v seg_objs, SegList.v) by address and
   anchor symbol (twin nm): A_OBJ 0 = 0xa3210 (the .got word the ld at 0x8a8b8 reads), A_OBJ 12 = 0xac7b8
   (__asan_shadow_memory_dynamic_address), A_OBJ 77 = RBC_CAT_OBJ = 0xa20a0 (fuzz_catalogue; SegList.v
   `PAddHi (10%bv : reg) (10%bv : reg) 123 (A_OBJ 77) 0x0` at 0x8a8dc), AF_reac_box_catalogue = 0x5ae0 =
   0x8a8a0 - seg_text 0x84dc0, atom 32 = the first extra env word (the shadow base SB, rbc_extra): 5 checked, 0
   pointing elsewhere.
   Image B's numbers of the statement: the entry BASE + AF_reac_box_catalogue; STK_reac_box_catalogue = 16 (the
   contract's STK comment: its frame, 0x8a8a0 addi sp,sp,-16 released at 0x8a8e4; the unimp at 0x8a8ec and the jal
   at 0x8a8f0 are the dead trap and error arms; no callee); cat = catA = 0xa20a0. Both are lib/B/Prog/SegInstB.v's
   definitions (SegInstA's names at image B): SegInstB.STK_reac_box_catalogue and SegInstB.catA, tied to this walk
   by the lemmas STK_reac_box_catalogue_B (the value 16) and catA_B (listing object 77 of B's seg_objs). *)
