# How the binaries of `coturn/FuzzStunClient` were built

Generated from `PROVENANCE.yaml` beside this file. The build files are in `recipe/` (`recipe/MANIFEST.tsv` lists them) and the licence texts in `LICENSES/`.

| Entry point | `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` |
| Harness | `source/FuzzStunClient.c` from https://github.com/coturn/coturn `fuzzing/FuzzStunClient.c` at `70ca74e0bd83`; unmodified; licence BSD-3-Clause |
| Recipe | `recipe.tar.zst` of release `v2026.10.0-src` (sha256 `0339bf3221b15cd39513d46abe99062bac9cce874ed7ba5947753f75b6219ae5`), target `coturn-FuzzStunClient` |
| Build system | cmake |
| Patches to the library | none |

| Builder image | `ghcr.io/theorem-labs/oss-fuzz-theorems-toolchain@sha256:6a6b4816865c7ec61801ae0fcab6d9c81a599ffcb20616576a9c668abd8b0a7b` |
| Static AddressSanitizer | https://github.com/theorem-labs/static-asan at `b05061352064fa2be1813ac5429149f3de5f057d` (the published source of the compiler image's static AddressSanitizer: its toolchain/ and patches/ are those the image was built from, with comments and patch descriptions edited for publication (toolchain-src.tar.zst holds this commit). Building it gives the image's libclang_rt.builtins.a and musl libc.a byte for byte; its libclang_rt.asan.a and asan_cxx.a differ from the image's only in DWARF line tables, which --strip-all removes from the binaries) |
| Source code | not required by the licences; upstream https://github.com/coturn/coturn at `70ca74e0bd8300e22a179e9a7beead862763ca5c` |

## Rebuild

- rebuilt from this recipe and the source assets on a separate machine: plain identical, asan identical, ubsan identical, asan-ubsan identical

## The proofs' licence

The proof files of this entry point were made from final-anthropic-opensource-formal-verification-proofs-package-2026-10-21 (sha256 4c6c152f61ce538e439b9d2adef439f4dbe1a2d446767d84ac7c3946d7c6687a), libraries/coturn/proofs/submission-1, libraries/boost-beast/proofs/submission-1, libraries/leptonica/proofs/submission-1, libraries/jsoncons/proofs/submission-5, libraries/zstd/proofs/submission-1, libraries/cgif/proofs/submission-2 and libraries/brotli/proofs/submission-1 and are under Apache-2.0 OR MIT, at the recipient's option: the licence texts and the notice are `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-LICENSE`, `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSES/anthropic-proofs-NOTICE` in the repository's top directory; each changed file carries one line under its licence header saying so. The proofs of asan_agrees and asan_ubsan_agrees were written in this repository: they restate the package's theorems at the 2 GiB budget, through lib/RefLim.v.

## Compiler and linker flags

As written in the recipe; a library's own build system adds its flags after these (e.g. CMake Release appends -O3 -DNDEBUG), see the pin and recipes.sh.
