(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10-29: copied from proofs/cgif/cgif_file_fuzzer/lib/YB1m.v, with its module paths changed; this is the form the image-B' collector's certificate used (harness fix #102, pin d663f82d7f488d30, unstripped twin c90d4fa54d43160b). The certificate file of that run is ZStartColRB/Cert.v of the donor workspace (worktree h-pre-b3-donor2/proofs/cgif/cgif_file_fuzzer/lib/ZStartColRB/Cert.v, written by tools/startup/colrun.py install, run sha 59778df6f00b34ac): the same IT0 = mk_itab_ranges TSEGS startup_plan_tfib_ranges, the same BFUEL 400000 and FUEL 3000, and the same `check` application over HS_tfib and startup_plan_tfib. Its `Eval vm_compute` printed (0, 0, Some (SCase (EVar 6) 10 (SAlt2 (SAlt2 (SHole 8) (SHole 9)) (SAlt2 (SHole 0) (SHole 1))) (SCase (EVar 6) 1802 (SAlt2 (SAlt2 (SHole 24) (SHole 25)) (SAlt2 (SHole 16) (SHole 17))) (SAlt2 (SHole 36) (SHole 32))))) -- COk with exactly the startup_shape below, holes 0,1,8,9,16,17,24,25,32,36, so the shape and the two fuels of this file are unchanged by the re-pin and no numeral here moves. Build rc=0, wall 1,023 s, log worktree h-pre-b3-donor2.logs/hpb3-donor-b-rbuild-20261029T154734Z.log; record h-pre-b3's PREP.md. The plan it accepted is lib/Reusable/YB05.v and the states lib/Reusable/YB01.v / YB03.v of this tree. *)
(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10-29: route R1 (h-hpreset-7, bad7e00334f; merged here at aa104f59e1c) edits this file: SINV0 in the hypothesis HOLES_sound is applied to TSEGS as its new first argument. A re-relocation from cgif must re-apply it. *)
