(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: copied from projects/cgif/cgif_file_fuzzer/proofs/lib/A/AFfw.v, with its module paths changed and its addresses moved to libreac/fuzz_knock's ASan build; AB1v's tfibsegs is A/AWalkFw0.v's. *)

(* Modified by Theorem Labs, 2026-10: derived from lib/A/AFfw.v of this library by derive_y.py: module names A.Axyz -> AU.Yxyz, addresses moved from libdiginet/fuzz_codec's asan image to its asan-ubsan image. The Modified-by lines above describe how lib/A/AFfw.v was made and quote that file's asan-image values; the code below carries the asan-ubsan values. *)
